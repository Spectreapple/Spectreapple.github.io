                Barry is a 2D platform puzzle game<br>
                It's a short but impacting brain game where<br>
                you as the player are being challenged to use<br>
                Barry's unique abilities<br>
                This project is also made in unity using c#<br>
                <br>
                Barry was made in a timewindow of 5 weeks,<br>
                all the assets are selfmade, I learned that time management<br>
                is the most important asset in game development<br>
                The workflow MosCow is used while making this project and everything<br>
                is carefully documented.
