                An seemingly endless climber<br>
                <br>
                A game full of hate and trial and error<br>
                <br>
                This is the perfect description for our upcoming release Umbra's ascent<br>
                made in Unity using c#<br>
                This project was made as an experiment for arduino input<br>
                So we made an arduino controller to work as movement<br>
                for the character which was a great learning curve!<br>
                The full release of Umbra is yet to be revealed.<br>
                This game is inspired by Bennet Foddy!
